This is the second major release of ct, and it comes with the integration of Essential. Essential comes
with many features, including cross-server friends, cosmetics, and more. For module authors, this means
that the latest versions of UniversalCraft, Elementa, and Vigilance will always be available for use in
modules.

### Additions

- Integrated [Essential](https://essential.gg/) into CT
- **[BREAKING]** Added a bunch of GL and NBT imports to `moduleProvidedLibs.js`
  - If your modules has these defined, it will error. 
- Added a bunch of `Tessellator` methods, most notably `pushMatrix` and `popMatrix`
- Added `Player#asEntity` method which returns the player as a CT `Entity` object
- Added `Entity#{getMaxHP,distanceTo}` methods
- Added `FileLib.{exists,isDirectory}`
- Added an optional `changelog` field to `metadata.json` for authors to write a basic changelog (@Squagward)
- Added `NBTTagCompound#toObject` to convert NBT to a JS object (@DJtheRedstoner)
  - Note that this is potentially performance-adverse, and should probably not be used in hot code
- Added `Player.getLast{X,Y,Z}` and `Player.getRender{X,Y,Z}` methods (@kerbybit)

### Fixes

- **[BREAKING]** Tick trigger now correctly fires 20 times a second (it previously fired 40 times a second) (@FalseHonesty)
  - The `tick` trigger is not meant for timing. If you need precise timing control, use the `step` trigger instead.
- Fixed `step` not firing in certain GUIs.
- Removed old Frames+ check, which caused log spam and the occasional crash
- Fixed hang on launch on Ubuntu
- Fixed `Book#{add,set}Page` crashing due to a `ClassCastException` (@Maxssho13)
- Fixed `TabList#setFooter` setting the header (@Maxssho13)
- Fixed `package{Sent,Received}` triggers not firing properly (@Maxssho13)
- Fixed not firing `gameUnload` trigger during shutdown
- Fixed `blockBreak` trigger not working (@Squagward)
- Fixed `hitBlock` trigger always passing `(0, 0, 0)` as the block's position
- Fixed asmLib crash relating to accessing a non-existent property `indyHandle`
- Fixed buttons being added before `Gui` initialization not being registered (@Squagward)

### Changes

- **[BREAKING]** Completely overhaul the `Block` API
  - Previously, `Block` represented both the abstract idea of a block _and_ a particular block placed in the world. These have now been separated into `BlockType` and `Block` (which is a particular `BlockType` at a `BlockPos`)
  - Also includes more `moduleProvidedLibs.js` imports
- Triggers are now internally sorted by type instead of all being in one big set, which will improve performance
- The loader now recursively searched for .jar files, meaning they can be placed in nested folders instead of having to be top level
- Updated to Kotlin 1.5 (this should improve compatibility with some other mods)
- The CT block in crashlogs now only print the name and version
- Added some flags to `Renderer.drawPlayer` to allow more fine-grained control over the player rendering (@Debuggingss)
- Rewrote the `/ct config` GUI to use Vigilance
- The update checker will now consider patch versions

### Rhino

- Fixed `let`/`const` use in for-each loop head
- Fixed `instanceof` for java classes and objects (@FalseHonesty)
- Fixed `Proxy` incorrectly checking handler prototype for existence of trap methods
- Fixed not being able to convert `Symbol` to object
- Fixed `typeof` crashing when given a `Symbol`
